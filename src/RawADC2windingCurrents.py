"""
This Code is used to process the data collected from the ADC Sled on
the Space System Lab's UMD 2019 Rocksat X robotic payload.

This program takes the data file that is generated by ADCSledRaw2Dat.py
and converts the intermediate raw values into real currents. Although
this could have been incorporated into the first file it was felt to
be prudent to pull this into a separate program to be able to reduce
the memory load on the system when processing a bunch of files in a row

This program also reads in a configuration file from the current working
directory that contains the calibration data from the sensors as a yaml
file. This will allow for easy to parse and read calibration values for
the system. The configuration file must exist in the path relative to 
this program.

../config/ADCSledCurrentSenseCalbration.yaml

This tool will accept commands as follows and is written in Python 3 and
expecting input for files in Unix style

python3 RawADC2windingCurrents.py /Input/File/Path.dat /Output/Files/Folder/
