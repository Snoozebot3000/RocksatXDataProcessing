"""
This Code is used to process the data collected from the ADC Sled on
the Space System Lab's UMD 2019 Rocksat X robotic payload.

The purpose is to take the raw file and convert it to several separate
data files for each of the sensors. The script will take two inputs
from the command line. The first is the path of the data file that is
being parsed. The second is the location to store the data files that
have been parsed from the raw data file.

This tool will accept commands as follows and is written in Python 3

python3 ADCSledRaw2Dat.py /Input/File/Path.dat /Output/Files/Folder/
